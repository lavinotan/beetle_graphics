# Beettle Graphics
A simple C++ program and algorithm to mimic a beetle's movement, then to draw its determined path into graphics  on Command Prompt by using a series of commands (cmds). It is similar to the "Turtle Graphics", the Logo language. 

## Instructions
1. Download as a whole or clone.
2. Run BeetleGraphics.exe in Debug\ folder.

## Requirements & Technologies
* Demonstration the usage of C++ reference, enum, array, loop, and switch practices.
* Implementation of software design pattern with C++ object-oriented programming, layered architecture, and code seperation of header and source files.
* The graphics, represented by *, is only painted when the beetle wants to release its hormone to track its determined path.
